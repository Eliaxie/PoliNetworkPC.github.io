                            This site, created by <a href="https://polinetwork.github.io/en/"> PoliNetwork</a>,
                            aims to make programs and candidates as clear as possible to students.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The site was created in collaboration with the same candidate lists, which provided texts and images.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The order of the lists displayed is <i> random </i> on each page, which means that if you reload the page, the order will likely change.
                        </p>
